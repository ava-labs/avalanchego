# Releasing

## Procedure

### Release candidate

ℹ️ you should always create a release candidate first, and only if everything is fine, you can create a release.

In this section, we create a release candidate `v0.15.0-rc.0`. We therefore assign these environment variables to simplify copying instructions:

```bash
export VERSION_RC=v0.15.0-rc.0
export VERSION=v0.15.0
```

1. Create your branch, usually from the tip of the `master` branch:

    ```bash
    git fetch origin master:master
    git checkout master
    git checkout -b "releases/$VERSION_RC"
    ```

1. Update the [RELEASES.md](../../RELEASES.md) file by renaming the "Pending" section to the new release version `$VERSION` and creating a new "Pending" section at the top.
1. Modify the [plugin/evm/version.go](../../plugin/evm/version.go) `Version` global string variable and set it to the desired `$VERSION`.
1. Because AvalancheGo and coreth depend on each other, and that we create releases of AvalancheGo before coreth, you can use a recent commit hash or recent release candidate of AvalancheGo in your `go.mod` file. Coreth releases should be tightly coordinated with AvalancheGo releases.
1. Commit your changes and push the branch

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -S -m "chore: release $VERSION_RC"
    git push -u origin "releases/$VERSION_RC"
    ```

1. Create a pull request (PR) from your branch targeting master, for example using [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/):

    ```bash
    gh pr create --repo github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm --base master --title "chore: release $VERSION_RC"
    ```

1. Wait for the PR checks to pass with

    ```bash
    gh pr checks --watch
    ```

1. Squash and merge your release branch into `master`, for example:

    ```bash
    gh pr merge "releases/$VERSION" --squash --delete-branch --subject "chore: release $VERSION" --body "\n- Update AvalancheGo from v1.12.3 to v1.13.0"
    ```

1. Create and push a tag from the `master` branch:

    ```bash
    git fetch origin master:master
    git checkout master
    # Double check the tip of the master branch is the expected commit
    # of the squashed release branch
    git log -1
    git tag -s "$VERSION_RC"
    git push origin "$VERSION_RC"
    ```

1. Once the release candidate tag is created, create a pull request on the AvalancheGo repository, bumping the coreth dependency to use this release candidate. Once proven stable, an AvalancheGo release should be created, after which you can create a coreth release.

### Release

If a successful release candidate was created and integrated in a release of AvalancheGo, you can now create a release.

Following the previous example in the [Release candidate section](#release-candidate) we will create a release `v0.15.0` indicated by the `$VERSION` variable.

1. Create and push a tag from the `master` branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    git pull origin
    # Double check the tip of the master branch is the expected commit
    # of the squashed release branch
    git log -1
    git tag -s "$VERSION"
    git push origin "$VERSION"
    ```

1. Create a new release on Github, either using:
    - the [Github web interface](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases/new)
        1. In the "Choose a tag" box, select the tag previously created `$VERSION` (`v0.15.0`)
        1. Pick the previous tag, for example as `v0.14.0`.
        1. Set the "Release title" to `$VERSION` (`v0.15.0`)
        1. Set the description using this format:

            ```markdown
            This is the Coreth version used in AvalancheGo@v1.13.1

            # Breaking changes

            # Features

            # Fixes

            # Documentation

            ```

        1. Only tick the box "Set as the latest release"
        1. Click on the "Create release" button
    - the Github CLI `gh`:

        ```bash
        PREVIOUS_VERSION=v0.14.0
        NOTES="This is the Coreth version used in AvalancheGo@v1.13.1

        # Breaking changes

        # Features

        # Fixes

        # Documentation

        "
        gh release create "$VERSION" --notes-start-tag "$PREVIOUS_VERSION" --notes-from-tag "$VERSION" --title "$VERSION" --notes "$NOTES" --verify-tag
        ```

Note this release will likely never be used in AvalancheGo, which should always be using release candidates to accelerate the development process. However it is still useful to have a release to indicate the last stable version of coreth.
