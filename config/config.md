# AvalancheGo Configs and Flags

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD001 -->

You can specify the configuration of a node with the arguments below.

## Data Directory

#### `--data-dir` (string)

Sets the base data directory where default sub-directories will be placed unless otherwise specified.
Defaults to `$HOME/.avalanchego`.

## Config File

#### `--config-file` (string)

Path to a JSON file that specifies this node's configuration. Command line
arguments will override arguments set in the config file. This flag is ignored
if `--config-file-content` is specified.

Example JSON config file:

```json
{
  "log-level": "debug"
}
```

:::tip
[Install Script](/nodes/run/with-installer/installing-avalanchego.md) creates the
node config file at `~/.avalanchego/configs/node.json`. No default file is
created if [AvalancheGo is built from source](/nodes/run/node-manually.md), you
would need to create it manually if needed.
:::

#### `--config-file-content` (string)

As an alternative to `--config-file`, it allows specifying base64 encoded config
content.

#### `--config-file-content-type` (string)

Specifies the format of the base64 encoded config content. JSON, TOML, YAML are
among currently supported file format (see
[here](https://github.com/spf13/viper#reading-config-files) for full list). Defaults to `JSON`.

## Avalanche Community Proposals

#### `--acp-support` (array of integers)

The `--acp-support` flag allows an AvalancheGo node to indicate support for a
set of [Avalanche Community Proposals](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs).

#### `--acp-object` (array of integers)

The `--acp-object` flag allows an AvalancheGo node to indicate objection for a
set of [Avalanche Community Proposals](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs).

## APIs

#### `--api-admin-enabled` (boolean)

If set to `true`, this node will expose the Admin API. Defaults to `false`.
See [here](/reference/avalanchego/admin-api.md) for more information.

#### `--api-health-enabled` (boolean)

If set to `false`, this node will not expose the Health API. Defaults to `true`. See
[here](/reference/avalanchego/health-api.md) for more information.

#### `--index-enabled` (boolean)

If set to `true`, this node will enable the indexer and the Index API will be
available. Defaults to `false`. See
[here](/reference/avalanchego/index-api.md) for more information.

#### `--api-info-enabled` (boolean)

If set to `false`, this node will not expose the Info API. Defaults to `true`. See
[here](/reference/avalanchego/info-api.md) for more information.

#### `--api-keystore-enabled` (boolean)

If set to `true`, this node will expose the Keystore API. Defaults to `false`.
See [here](/reference/avalanchego/keystore-api.md) for more information.

#### `--api-metrics-enabled` (boolean)

If set to `false`, this node will not expose the Metrics API. Defaults to
`true`. See [here](/reference/avalanchego/metrics-api.md) for more information.

#### `--http-shutdown-wait` (duration)

Duration to wait after receiving SIGTERM or SIGINT before initiating shutdown.
The `/health` endpoint will return unhealthy during this duration (if the Health
API is enabled.) Defaults to `0s`.

#### `--http-shutdown-timeout` (duration)

Maximum duration to wait for existing connections to complete during node
shutdown. Defaults to `10s`.

## Bootstrapping

#### `--bootstrap-beacon-connection-timeout` (duration)

Timeout when attempting to connect to bootstrapping beacons. Defaults to `1m`.

#### `--bootstrap-ids` (string)

Bootstrap IDs is a comma-separated list of validator IDs. These IDs will be used
to authenticate bootstrapping peers. An example setting of this field would be
`--bootstrap-ids="NodeID-7Xhw2mDxuDS44j42TCB6U5579esbSt3Lg,NodeID-MFrZFVCXPv5iCn6M9K6XduxGTYp891xXZ"`.
The number of given IDs here must be same with number of given
`--bootstrap-ips`. The default value depends on the network ID.

#### `--bootstrap-ips` (string)

Bootstrap IPs is a comma-separated list of IP:port pairs. These IP Addresses
will be used to bootstrap the current Avalanche state. An example setting of
this field would be `--bootstrap-ips="127.0.0.1:12345,1.2.3.4:5678"`. The number
of given IPs here must be same with number of given `--bootstrap-ids`. The
default value depends on the network ID.

#### `--bootstrap-retry-enabled` (boolean)

If set to `false`, will not retry bootstrapping if it fails. Defaults to `true`.

#### `--bootstrap-retry-warn-frequency` (uint)

Specifies how many times bootstrap should be retried before warning the operator. Defaults to `50`.

#### `--bootstrap-ancestors-max-containers-sent` (uint)

This node reads at most this many containers from an incoming `Ancestors` message. Defaults to `2000`.

#### `--bootstrap-max-time-get-ancestors` (duration)

Max Time to spend fetching a container and its ancestors when responding to a GetAncestors message.
Defaults to `50ms`.

## State Syncing

#### `--state-sync-ids` (string)

State sync IDs is a comma-separated list of validator IDs. The specified
validators will be contacted to get and authenticate the starting point (state
summary) for state sync. An example setting of this field would be
`--state-sync-ids="NodeID-7Xhw2mDxuDS44j42TCB6U5579esbSt3Lg,NodeID-MFrZFVCXPv5iCn6M9K6XduxGTYp891xXZ"`.
The number of given IDs here must be same with number of given
`--state-sync-ips`. The default value is empty, which results in all validators
being sampled.

#### `--state-sync-ips` (string)

State sync IPs is a comma-separated list of IP:port pairs. These IP Addresses
will be contacted to get and authenticate the starting point (state summary) for
state sync. An example setting of this field would be
`--state-sync-ips="127.0.0.1:12345,1.2.3.4:5678"`. The number of given IPs here
must be the same with the number of given `--state-sync-ids`.

## Partial Sync Primary Network

#### `--partial-sync-primary-network` (string)

Partial sync enables non-validators to optionally sync only the P-chain on the primary network.

## Chain Configs

Some blockchains allow the node operator to provide custom configurations for
individual blockchains. These custom configurations are broken down into two
categories: network upgrades and optional chain configurations. AvalancheGo
reads in these configurations from the chain configuration directory and passes
them into the VM on initialization.

#### `--chain-config-dir` (string)

Specifies the directory that contains chain configs, as described
[here](/nodes/configure/chain-configs/chain-config-flags.md). Defaults to `$HOME/.avalanchego/configs/chains`.
If this flag is not provided and the default directory does not exist,
AvalancheGo will not exit since custom configs are optional. However, if the
flag is set, the specified folder must exist, or AvalancheGo will exit with an
error. This flag is ignored if `--chain-config-content` is specified.

:::note
Please replace `chain-config-dir` and `blockchainID` with their actual values.
:::

Network upgrades are passed in from the location:
`chain-config-dir`/`blockchainID`/`upgrade.*`.
Upgrade files are typically json encoded and therefore named `upgrade.json`.
However, the format of the file is VM dependent.
After a blockchain has activated a network upgrade, the same upgrade
configuration must always be passed in to ensure that the network upgrades
activate at the correct time.

The chain configs are passed in from the location
`chain-config-dir`/`blockchainID`/`config.*`.
Upgrade files are typically json encoded and therefore named `upgrade.json`.
However, the format of the file is VM dependent.
This configuration is used by the VM to handle optional configuration flags such
as enabling/disabling APIs, updating log level, etc.
The chain configuration is intended to provide optional configuration parameters
and the VM will use default values if nothing is passed in.

Full reference for all configuration options for some standard chains can be
found in a separate [chain config flags](/nodes/configure/chain-configs/chain-config-flags.md) document.

Full reference for `subnet-evm` upgrade configuration can be found in a separate
[Customize a Subnet](/build/subnet/upgrade/customize-a-subnet.md) document.

#### `--chain-config-content` (string)

As an alternative to `--chain-config-dir`, chains custom configurations can be
loaded altogether from command line via `--chain-config-content` flag. Content
must be base64 encoded.

Example:

```bash
cchainconfig="$(echo -n '{"log-level":"trace"}' | base64)"
chainconfig="$(echo -n "{\"C\":{\"Config\":\"${cchainconfig}\",\"Upgrade\":null}}" | base64)"
avalanchego --chain-config-content "${chainconfig}"
```

#### `--chain-aliases-file` (string)

Path to JSON file that defines aliases for Blockchain IDs. Defaults to
`~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/aliases.json`. This flag is ignored if
`--chain-aliases-file-content` is specified. Example content:

```json
{
  "q2aTwKuyzgs8pynF7UXBZCU7DejbZbZ6EUyHr3JQzYgwNPUPi": ["DFK"]
}
```

The above example aliases the Blockchain whose ID is
`"q2aTwKuyzgs8pynF7UXBZCU7DejbZbZ6EUyHr3JQzYgwNPUPi"` to `"DFK"`. Chain
aliases are added after adding primary network aliases and before any changes to
the aliases via the admin API. This means that the first alias included for a
Blockchain on a Subnet will be treated as the `"Primary Alias"` instead of the
full blockchainID. The Primary Alias is used in all metrics and logs.

#### `--chain-aliases-file-content` (string)

As an alternative to `--chain-aliases-file`, it allows specifying base64 encoded
aliases for Blockchains.

#### `--chain-data-dir` (string)

Chain specific data directory. Defaults to `$HOME/.avalanchego/chainData`.

## Database

##### `--db-dir` (string, file path)

Specifies the directory to which the database is persisted. Defaults to `"$HOME/.avalanchego/db"`.

##### `--db-type` (string)

Specifies the type of database to use. Must be one of `leveldb`, `memdb`, or `pebbledb`.
`memdb` is an in-memory, non-persisted database.

:::note

`memdb` stores everything in memory. So if you have a 900 GiB LevelDB instance, then using `memdb`
you’d need 900 GiB of RAM.
`memdb` is useful for fast one-off testing, not for running an actual node (on Fuji or Mainnet).
Also note that `memdb` doesn’t persist after restart. So any time you restart the node it would
start syncing from scratch.

:::

### Database Config

#### `--db-config-file` (string)

Path to the database config file. Ignored if `--config-file-content` is specified.

#### `--db-config-file-content` (string)

```

## Genesis

#### `--genesis-file` (string)

Path to a JSON file containing the genesis data to use. Ignored when running
standard networks (Mainnet, Fuji Testnet), or when `--genesis-content` is
specified. If not given, uses default genesis data.

These are the main properties in the JSON file:

- `networkID`: A unique identifier for the blockchain, must be a number in the range [0, 2^32).
- `allocations`: The list of initial addresses, their initial balances and the unlock schedule for each.
- `startTime`: The time of the beginning of the blockchain, it must be a Unix
  timestamp and it can't be a time in the future.

  the `rewardAddress`, NodeID and the `delegationFee` of the validator.
- `cChainGenesis`: The genesis info to be passed to the C-Chain.
- `message`: A message to include in the genesis. Not required.

For an example of a JSON representation of genesis data, see [genesis_local.json](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/genesis/genesis_local.json).

#### `--genesis-file-content` (string)

As an alternative to `--genesis-file`, it allows specifying base64 encoded genesis data to use.

## HTTP Server

#### `--http-host` (string)

The address that HTTP APIs listen on. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`. This means that
by default, your node can only handle API calls made from the same machine. To
allow API calls from other machines, use `--http-host=`. You can also enter
domain names as parameter.

#### `--http-port` (int)

Each node runs an HTTP server that provides the APIs for interacting with the
node and the Avalanche network. This argument specifies the port that the HTTP
server will listen on. The default value is `9650`.

#### `--http-tls-cert-file` (string, file path)

This argument specifies the location of the TLS certificate used by the node for
the HTTPS server. This must be specified when `--http-tls-enabled=true`. There
is no default value. This flag is ignored if `--http-tls-cert-file-content` is
specified.

#### `--http-tls-cert-file-content` (string)

As an alternative to `--http-tls-cert-file`, it allows specifying base64 encoded
content of the TLS certificate used by the node for the HTTPS server. Note that
full certificate content, with the leading and trailing header, must be base64
encoded. This must be specified when `--http-tls-enabled=true`.

#### `--http-tls-enabled` (boolean)

If set to `true`, this flag will attempt to upgrade the server to use HTTPS. Defaults to `false`.

#### `--http-tls-key-file` (string, file path)

This argument specifies the location of the TLS private key used by the node for
the HTTPS server. This must be specified when `--http-tls-enabled=true`. There
is no default value. This flag is ignored if `--http-tls-key-file-content` is
specified.

#### `--http-tls-key-file-content` (string)

As an alternative to `--http-tls-key-file`, it allows specifying base64 encoded
content of the TLS private key used by the node for the HTTPS server. Note that
full private key content, with the leading and trailing header, must be base64
encoded. This must be specified when `--http-tls-enabled=true`.

#### `--http-read-timeout` (string)

Maximum duration for reading the entire request, including the body. A zero or
negative value means there will be no timeout.

#### `--http-read-header-timeout` (string)

Maximum duration to read request headers. The connection’s read deadline is
reset after reading the headers. If `--http-read-header-timeout` is zero, the
value of `--http-read-timeout` is used. If both are zero, there is no timeout.

#### `--http-write-timeout` (string)

Maximum duration before timing out writes of the response. It is reset whenever
a new request’s header is read. A zero or negative value means there will be no
timeout.

#### `--http-idle-timeout` (string)

Maximum duration to wait for the next request when keep-alives are enabled. If
`--http-idle-timeout` is zero, the value of `--http-read-timeout` is used. If both are zero,
there is no timeout.

#### `--http-allowed-origins` (string)

Origins to allow on the HTTP port. Defaults to `*` which allows all origins. Example:
`"https://*.avax.network https://*.avax-test.network"`

#### `--http-allowed-hosts` (string)

List of acceptable host names in API requests. Provide the wildcard (`'*'`) to accept
requests from all hosts. API requests where the `Host` field is empty or an IP address
will always be accepted. An API call whose HTTP `Host` field isn't acceptable will
receive a 403 error code. Defaults to `localhost`.

## File Descriptor Limit

#### `--fd-limit` (int)

Attempts to raise the process file descriptor limit to at least this value and
error if the value is above the system max. Linux default `32768`.

## Logging

#### `--log-level` (string, `{verbo, debug, trace, info, warn, error, fatal, off}`)

The log level determines which events to log. There are 8 different levels, in
order from highest priority to lowest.

- `off`: No logs have this level of logging. Turns off logging.
- `fatal`: Fatal errors that are not recoverable.
- `error`: Errors that the node encounters, these errors were able to be recovered.
- `warn`: A Warning that might be indicative of a spurious byzantine node, or potential future error.
- `info`: Useful descriptions of node status updates.
- `trace`: Traces container (block, vertex, transaction) job results. Useful for
  tracing container IDs and their outcomes.
- `debug`: Debug logging is useful when attempting to understand possible bugs
  in the code. More information that would be typically desired for normal usage
  will be displayed.
- `verbo`: Tracks extensive amounts of information the node is processing. This
  includes message contents and binary dumps of data for extremely low level
  protocol analysis.

When specifying a log level note that all logs with the specified priority or
higher will be tracked. Defaults to `info`.

#### `--log-display-level` (string, `{verbo, debug, trace, info, warn, error, fatal, off}`)

The log level determines which events to display to stdout. If left blank,
will default to the value provided to `--log-level`.

#### `--log-format` (string, `{auto, plain, colors, json}`)

The structure of log format. Defaults to `auto` which formats terminal-like
logs, when the output is a terminal. Otherwise, should be one of `{auto, plain, colors, json}`

#### `--log-dir` (string, file path)

Specifies the directory in which system logs are kept. Defaults to `"$HOME/.avalanchego/logs"`.
If you are running the node as a system service (ex. using the installer script) logs will also be
stored in `$HOME/var/log/syslog`.

#### `--log-disable-display-plugin-logs` (boolean)

Disables displaying plugin logs in stdout. Defaults to `false`.

#### `--log-rotater-max-size` (uint)

The maximum file size in megabytes of the log file before it gets rotated. Defaults to `8`.

#### `--log-rotater-max-files` (uint)

The maximum number of old log files to retain. 0 means retain all old log files. Defaults to `7`.

#### `--log-rotater-max-age` (uint)

The maximum number of days to retain old log files based on the timestamp
encoded in their filename. 0 means retain all old log files. Defaults to `0`.

#### `--log-rotater-compress-enabled` (boolean)

Enables the compression of rotated log files through gzip. Defaults to `false`.

## Network ID

#### `--network-id` (string)

The identity of the network the node should connect to. Can be one of:

- `--network-id=mainnet` -&gt; Connect to Mainnet (default).
- `--network-id=fuji` -&gt; Connect to the Fuji test-network.
- `--network-id=testnet` -&gt; Connect to the current test-network. (Right now, this is Fuji.)
- `--network-id=local` -&gt; Connect to a local test-network.
- `--network-id=network-{id}` -&gt; Connect to the network with the given ID.
  `id` must be in the range `[0, 2^32)`.

## OpenTelemetry

AvalancheGo supports collecting and exporting [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) traces.
This might be useful for debugging, performance analysis, or monitoring.

#### `--tracing-enabled` (boolean)

If true, enable OpenTelemetry tracing. Defaults to `false`.

#### `--tracing-endpoint` (string)

The endpoint to export trace data to. Defaults to `localhost:4317`.

#### `--tracing-insecure` (string)

If true, don't use TLS when exporting trace data. Defaults to `true`.

#### `--tracing-sample-rate` (float)

The fraction of traces to sample. If >= 1, always sample. If `<= 0`, never sample.
Defaults to `0.1`.

#### `--tracing-exporter-type`(string)

Type of exporter to use for tracing. Options are [`grpc`,`http`]. Defaults to `grpc`.

## Public IP

Validators must know one of their public facing IP addresses so they can enable
other nodes to connect to them.

By default, the node will attempt to perform NAT traversal to get the node's IP
according to its router.

#### `--public-ip` (string)

If this argument is provided, the node assume this is its public IP.

:::tip
When running a local network it may be easiest to set this value to `127.0.0.1`.
:::

#### `--public-ip-resolution-frequency` (duration)

Frequency at which this node resolves/updates its public IP and renew NAT
mappings, if applicable. Default to 5 minutes.

#### `--public-ip-resolution-service` (string)

When provided, the node will use that service to periodically resolve/update its
public IP. Only acceptable values are `ifconfigCo`, `opendns` or `ifconfigMe`.

## Staking

#### `--staking-port` (int)

The port through which the network peers will connect to this node externally.
Having this port accessible from the internet is required for correct node
operation. Defaults to `9651`.

#### `--sybil-protection-enabled` (boolean)

Avalanche uses Proof of Stake (PoS) as sybil resistance to make it prohibitively
expensive to attack the network. If false, sybil resistance is disabled and all
peers will be sampled during consensus. Defaults to `true`. Note that this can
not be disabled on public networks (`Fuji` and `Mainnet`).

Setting this flag to `false` **does not** mean "this node is not a validator."
It means that this node will sample all nodes, not just validators.
**You should not set this flag to false unless you understand what you are doing.**

#### `--sybil-protection-disabled-weight` (uint)

Weight to provide to each peer when staking is disabled. Defaults to `100`.

#### `--staking-tls-cert-file` (string, file path)

Avalanche uses two-way authenticated TLS connections to securely connect nodes.
This argument specifies the location of the TLS certificate used by the node. By
default, the node expects the TLS certificate to be at
`$HOME/.avalanchego/staking/staker.crt`. This flag is ignored if
`--staking-tls-cert-file-content` is specified.

#### `--staking-tls-cert-file-content` (string)

As an alternative to `--staking-tls-cert-file`, it allows specifying base64
encoded content of the TLS certificate used by the node. Note that full
certificate content, with the leading and trailing header, must be base64
encoded.

#### `--staking-tls-key-file` (string, file path)

Avalanche uses two-way authenticated TLS connections to securely connect nodes.
This argument specifies the location of the TLS private key used by the node. By
default, the node expects the TLS private key to be at
`$HOME/.avalanchego/staking/staker.key`. This flag is ignored if
`--staking-tls-key-file-content` is specified.

#### `--staking-tls-key-file-content` (string)

As an alternative to `--staking-tls-key-file`, it allows specifying base64
encoded content of the TLS private key used by the node. Note that full private
key content, with the leading and trailing header, must be base64 encoded.

## Subnets

### Subnet Tracking

#### `--track-subnets` (string)

Comma separated list of Subnet IDs that this node would track if added to.
Defaults to empty (will only validate the Primary Network).

### Subnet Configs

It is possible to provide parameters for Subnets. Parameters here apply to all
chains in the specified Subnets. Parameters must be specified with a
`{subnetID}.json` config file under `--subnet-config-dir`. AvalancheGo loads
configs for Subnets specified in
`--track-subnets` parameter.

Full reference for all configuration options for a Subnet can be found in a
separate [Subnet Configs](./subnet-configs) document.

#### `--subnet-config-dir` (`string`)

Specifies the directory that contains Subnet configs, as described above.
Defaults to `$HOME/.avalanchego/configs/subnets`. If the flag is set explicitly,
the specified folder must exist, or AvalancheGo will exit with an error. This
