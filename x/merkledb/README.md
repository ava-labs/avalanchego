## Introduction

The Merkle Trie is a data structure that allows efficient and secure verification of the contents. It is a combination of a [Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) and a [Radix Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree).

The trie contains `Merkle Nodes`, which store key/value and children information.

Each `Merkle Node` represents a key path into the trie. It stores the key, the value (if one exists), its ID, and the IDs of its children nodes. The children have keys that contain the current node's key path as a prefix, and the index of each child indicates the next nibble in that child's key. For example, if we have two nodes, Node 1 with key path `0x91A` and Node 2 with key path `0x91A4`, Node 2 is stored in index `0x4` of Node 1's children (since 0x4 is the first value after the common prefix).

To reduce the depth of nodes in the trie, a `Merkle Node` utilizes path compression. Instead of having a long chain of nodes each containing only a single nibble of the key, we can "compress" the path by recording additional key information with each of a node's children. For example, if we have three nodes, Node 1 with key path `0x91A`, Node 2 with key path `0x91A4`, and Node 3 with key path `0x91A5132`, then Node 1 has a key of `0x91A`. Node 2 is stored at index `0x4` of Node 1's children since `4` is the next nibble in Node 2's key after skipping the common nibbles from Node 1's key. Node 3 is stored at index `0x5` of Node 1's children. Rather than have extra nodes for the remainder of Node 3's key, we instead store the rest of the key (`132`) in Node 1's children info.

| Merkle Node                       | 
|                                   |
| ID: 0x0131                        |  an id representing the current node, derived from the node's value and all children ids
| Key: 0x91                         |  prefix of the key path, representing the location of the node in the trie
| Value: 0x00                       |  the value, if one exists, that is stored at the key path (pathPrefix + compressedPath)
| Children:                         |  a map of children node ids for any nodes in the trie that have this node's key path as a prefix 
|   0: [:0x00542F]                  |  child 0 represents a node with key 0x910 with ID 0x00542F
|   1: [0x432:0xA0561C]             |  child 1 represents a node with key 0x911432 with ID 0xA0561C
|   ...                             |
|   15: [0x9A67B:0x02FB093]         |  child 15 represents a node with key 0x91F9A67B with ID 0x02FB093

## Design choices

### Single node type

A `Merkle Node` holds the IDs of its children, its value, as well as any path extension. This simplifies some logic and allows all of the data about a node to be loaded in a single database read. This trades off a small amount of storage efficiency (some fields may be `nil` but are still stored for every node).

### Locking

A `trieView` is built atop another trie, which may be the underlying `Database` or another `trieView`.
It's important to guarantee atomicity/consistency of trie operations.
That is, if a view method is executing, the views/database underneath the view shouldn't be changing.
To prevent this, we need to use locking.

`trieView` has a `Mutex` named `lock` that's held when its methods are executing.
Trie methods also grab the write `lock` for all views that its built atop, and a read lock for the underlying `Database`.
The exception is `Commit`, which grabs a write lock for the `Database`.
This is the only `trieView` method that modifies the underlying `Database`.
Locking the view stack ensures that while the method is executing, the underlying `Database` doesn't change, and no view below it is committed.

To prevent deadlocks, `trieView` and `Database` never lock a view that is built atop itself.
That is, locking is always done from a view down to the underlying `Database`, never the other way around.
In some of `Database`'s methods, we create a `trieView` and call unexported methods on it without locking it.
We do so because the exported counterpart of the method read locks the `Database`, which is already locked.
This pattern is safe because the `Database` is locked, so no data under the view is changing, and nobody else has a reference to the view, so there can't be any concurrent access.

`Database` has a `RWMutex` named `lock`. Its read operations don't store data in a map, so a read lock suffices for read operations.
`trieView`'s `Commit` method explicitly grabs this lock.
