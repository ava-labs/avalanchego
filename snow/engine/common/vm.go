	//     [chainCtx.chainID]: The unique ID of the chain this VM is running on.

	//     [chainCtx.Lock]: A Read/Write lock shared by this VM and the
	//                      consensus engine that manages this VM. The write
	//                      lock is held whenever code in the consensus engine

	//                 VM. The VM uses it to initialize its state. For
	//                 example, if this VM were an account-based payments
	//                 system, `genesisBytes` would probably contain a genesis
	//                 transaction that gives coins to some accounts, and this
	//                 transaction would be in the genesis block.
	// [toEngine]: The channel used to send messages to the consensus engine.
	// [fxs]: Feature extensions that attach to this VM.
