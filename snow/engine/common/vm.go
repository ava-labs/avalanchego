	//     [ctx.Log]: Used to log messages
	//     [ctx.NodeID]: The unique staker ID of this node.
	//     [ctx.Lock]: A Read/Write lock shared by this VM and the consensus
	//                 engine that manages this VM. The write lock is held
	//                 whenever code in the consensus engine calls the VM.

	// [genesisBytes]: The byte-encoding of the genesis information of this
	//                 VM. The VM uses it to initialize its state. For
	//                 example, if this VM were an account-based payments
	//                 system, `genesisBytes` would probably contain a genesis
	//                 transaction that gives coins to some accounts, and this
	//                 transaction would be in the genesis block.
	// [toEngine]: The channel used to send messages to the consensus engine.
	// [fxs]: Feature extensions that attach to this VM.
