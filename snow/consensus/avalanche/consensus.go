// TODO: Implement pruning of accepted decisions.
// To perfectly preserve the protocol, this implementation will need to store
// the hashes of all accepted decisions. It is possible to add a heuristic that
// removes sufficiently old decisions. However, that will need to be analyzed to
// ensure safety. It is doable with a weak syncrony assumption.

// Consensus represents a general avalanche instance that can be used directly
// to process a series of partially ordered elements.
