// that result in at least Alpha votes will record the poll on their children.
// Every other block will have an unsuccessful poll registered.
//
// After collecting which blocks should be voted on, the polls are registered
// and blocks are accepted/rejected as needed. The tail is then updated to equal
// the leaf on the preferred branch.
//
// To optimize the theoretical complexity of the vote propagation, a topological
// sort is done over the blocks that are reachable from the provided votes.
// During the sort, votes are pushed towards the genesis. To prevent interating
// over all blocks that had unsuccessful polls, we set a flag on the block to
// know that any future traversal through that block should register an
// unsuccessful poll on that block and every descendant block.

// - Runtime = 3 * |live set| + |votes|

//   1) IDs of accepted vertices, or the empty set if there are none
