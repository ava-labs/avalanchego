# Release Notes

## [v1.7.5](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.7.5)

This version is backwards compatible to [v1.7.0](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.7.0). It is optional, but encouraged.

### Consensus

- Added asynchronous processing of `App.*` messages.
- Added height indexing support to the `proposervm` and `rpcchainvm`. If a node is updated to `>=v1.7.5` and then downgraded to `<v1.7.5`, the user must enable the `--reset-proposervm-height-index=true` flag to ensure the `proposervm` height index is correctly updated going forward.
- Fixed bootstrapping job counter initialization that could cause negative ETAs to be reported.
- Fixed incorrect processing check that could log incorrect information.
- Removed incorrect warning logs.

### Miscellaneous

- Added tracked subnets to be reported in calls to the `info.peers` API.
- Updated gRPC implementations to use `buf` tooling and standardized naming and locations.
- Added a consistent hashing implementation to be used in future improvements.
- Fixed database iteration invariants to report `ErrClosed` rather than silently exiting.
- Added additional sanity checks to prevent users from incorrectly configuring their node.
- Updated log timestamps to include milliseconds.

### Coreth

- Added beta support for offline pruning.
- Refactored peer networking layer.
- Enabled cheap metrics by default.
- Marked RPC call metrics as expensive.
- Added Abigen support for native asset call precompile.
- Fixed bug in BLOCKHASH opcode during traceBlock.
- Fixed bug in handling updated chain config on startup.

## [v1.7.4](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.7.4)

This version is backwards compatible to [v1.7.0](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.7.0). It is optional, but encouraged.

**The first startup of the C-Chain will take a few minutes longer due to an index update.**

### Consensus

- Removed deprecated Snowstorm consensus implementation that no longer aligned with the updated specification.
- Updated bootstrapping logs to no longer reset counters after a node restart.
- Added bootstrapping ETAs for fetching Snowman blocks and executing operations.
- Renamed the `MultiPut` message to the `Ancestors` message to match other message naming conventions.
- Introduced Whitelist conflicts into the Snowstorm specification that will be used in future X-chain improvements.
- Refactored the separation between the Bootstrapping engine and the Consensus engine to support Fast-Sync.

### Coreth

- Added an index mapping height to the list of accepted atomic operations at that height in a trie. Generating this index will cause the node to take a few minutes longer to startup the C-Chain for the first restart.
- Updated Geth dependency to `v1.10.15`.
- Updated `networkID` to match `chainID`.

### VMs

- Refactored `platformvm` rewards calculations to enable usage from an external library.
- Fixed `platformvm` and `avm` UTXO fetching to not re-iterate the UTXO set if no UTXOs are fetched.
- Refactored `platformvm` status definitions.
- Added support for multiple address balance lookups in the `platformvm`.
- Refactored `platformvm` and `avm` keystore users to reuse similar code.

### RPCChainVM

- Returned a `500 InternalServerError` if an unexpected gRPC error occurs during the handling of an HTTP request to a plugin.
- Updated gRPC server's max message size to enable responses larger than 4MiB from the plugin's handling of an HTTP request.

### Configs

- Added `--stake-max-consumption-rate` which defaults to `120,000`.
- Added `--stake-min-consumption-rate` which defaults to `100,000`.
- Added `--stake-supply-cap` which defaults to `720,000,000,000,000,000` nAVAX.
- Renamed `--bootstrap-multiput-max-containers-sent` to `--bootstrap-ancestors-max-containers-sent`.
- Renamed `--bootstrap-multiput-max-containers-received` to `--bootstrap-ancestors-max-containers-received`.
- Enforced that `--staking-enabled=false` can not be specified on public networks (`Fuji` and `Mainnet`).

### Metrics

- All `multi_put` metrics were converted to `ancestors` metrics.

### Miscellaneous

- Improved `corruptabledb` error reporting by tracking the first reported error.
- Updated CPU tracking to use the proper EWMA tracker rather than a linear approximation.
- Separated health checks into `readiness`, `healthiness`, and `liveness` checks to support more fine-grained monitoring.
- Refactored API client utilities to use a `Context` rather than an explicit timeout.

This version is backwards compatible to [v1.7.0](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.7.0). It is optional, but encouraged.

### Consensus
