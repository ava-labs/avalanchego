### New Contributors

- @nytzuga made their first contribution in https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/pull/1790

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/compare/v1.10.8...v1.10.9

## [v1.10.8](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.10.8)

This version is backwards compatible to [v1.10.0](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.10.0). It is optional, but encouraged.

The plugin version is unchanged at `27` and compatible with versions `v1.10.5 - v1.10.7`.

**This update changes the local network genesis. This version will not be able to join local networks with prior versions.**

**The first startup of the P-Chain will perform indexing operations. This indexing runs in the background and does not impact restart time. During this indexing the node will report increased CPU, memory, and disk usage.**

### APIs

- Added `platform.getBlockByHeight`

### Configs

- Added `--partial-sync-primary-network` flag to enable non-validators to optionally sync only the P-chain on the primary network
- Added P-chain cache size configuration `block-id-cache-size`

### Fixes

- Fixed P-chain GetValidatorSet regression for subnets
- Changed `x/sync` range/change proof bounds from `[]byte` to `Maybe[[]byte]`
- Fixed `x/sync` error handling from failure to send app messages

### Consensus

- Added asynchronous processing of `App.*` messages.
- Added height indexing support to the `proposervm` and `rpcchainvm`. If a node is updated to `>=v1.7.5` and then downgraded to `<v1.7.5`, the user must enable the `--reset-proposervm-height-index=true` flag to ensure the `proposervm` height index is correctly updated going forward.

- Fixed incorrect processing check that could log incorrect information.
- Removed incorrect warning logs.

### Miscellaneous

- Added tracked subnets to be reported in calls to the `info.peers` API.
- Updated gRPC implementations to use `buf` tooling and standardized naming and locations.
- Added a consistent hashing implementation to be used in future improvements.
- Fixed database iteration invariants to report `ErrClosed` rather than silently exiting.
- Added additional sanity checks to prevent users from incorrectly configuring their node.
- Updated log timestamps to include milliseconds.

### Coreth

- Added beta support for offline pruning.
- Refactored peer networking layer.
- Enabled cheap metrics by default.

This version is backwards compatible to [v1.7.0](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/tag/v1.7.0). It is optional, but encouraged.

**The first startup of the C-Chain will take a few minutes longer due to an index update.**

### Consensus

- Updated `networkID` to match `chainID`.

### VMs

- Refactored `platformvm` rewards calculations to enable usage from an external library.

- Renamed `--bootstrap-multiput-max-containers-sent` to `--bootstrap-ancestors-max-containers-sent`.
- Renamed `--bootstrap-multiput-max-containers-received` to `--bootstrap-ancestors-max-containers-received`.

### Metrics

- All `multi_put` metrics were converted to `ancestors` metrics.

### Miscellaneous

- Improved `corruptabledb` error reporting by tracking the first reported error.
- Updated CPU tracking to use the proper EWMA tracker rather than a linear approximation.
- Separated health checks into `readiness`, `healthiness`, and `liveness` checks to support more fine-grained monitoring.
