# This action targets the project default version of setup-go. For
# workers with old NodeJS incompatible with newer versions of
# setup-go, try setup-go-for-project-v3.
#
# Since github actions do not support dynamically configuring the
# versions in a uses statement (e.g. `actions/setup-go@${{ var }}`) it
# is necessary to define an action per version rather than one action
# that can be parameterized.
#
# Must be run after actions/checkout to ensure go.mod is available to
# source the project's go version from.
