# How to Contribute to Avalanche

## Setup

To start developing on AvalancheGo, you'll need a few things installed.

- Golang version >= 1.19.6
- gcc
- g++

## Issues

### Did you find a bug?

- Do not open up a GitHub issue if a bug is a security vulnerability in AvalancheGo, and instead refer to our [security policy](../SECURITY.md).
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/issues/new). Be sure to include a *title and clear description*, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample/test case/reproduction of the bug if possible.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

- Changes from the community that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- The PR should be opened against the `dev` branch, which contains all of the latest changes that are ready to be released.
- If your PR isn't ready to be reviewed just yet, you can open it as a draft to collect early feedback on your changes.
- Once the PR is ready for review, mark it as ready-for-review and request review from one of the maintainers.

### Autogenerated code

- Any changes to protobuf message types require that protobuf files are regenerated.
```sh
./scripts/protobuf_codegen.sh
```
- To add or remove an interface that needs a corresponding mock generated, add it to the mock file [here](../mocks.mockgen.txt). You can regenerate the mocks by running the following script.
```sh
./scripts/mock.gen.sh
```

### Testing

#### Local

- Build the avalanchego binary
```
./scripts/build.sh
```

- Run unit tests
```
./scripts/build_test.sh
```

- Run the linter
```
./scripts/lint.sh
```

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Generally, pull requests will not be approved or merged unless they pass CI.
