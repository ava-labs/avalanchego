# Avalanche gRPC

Now Serving: **Protocol Version 26**

Protobuf files are hosted at
[https://buf.build/ava-labs/avalanche](https://buf.build/ava-labs/avalanche) and
can be used as dependencies in other projects.

Protobuf linting and generation for this project is managed by
[buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf).

Please find installation instructions on
[https://docs.buf.build/installation/](https://docs.buf.build/installation/) or
use `Dockerfile.buf` provided in the `proto/` directory of AvalancheGo.

Any changes made to proto definition can be updated by running
`protobuf_codegen.sh` located in the `scripts/` directory of AvalancheGo.

## Protocol Version Compatibility

The protobuf definitions and generated code are versioned based on the
[RPCChainVMProtocol](../version/version.go#L13) defined for the RPCChainVM.
Many versions of an Avalanche client can use the same
[RPCChainVMProtocol](../version/version.go#L13). But each Avalanche client and
subnet vm must use the same protocol version to be compatible.

## Publishing to Buf Schema Registry

- Checkout appropriate tag in AvalancheGo `git checkout v1.10.1`
- Change to proto/ directory `cd proto`.
- Publish new tag to buf registry. `buf push -t v26`

Note: Publishing requires auth to the ava-labs org in buf
