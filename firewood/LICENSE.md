Subject to the terms herein, Ava Labs, Inc. (**“Ava Labs”**) hereby grants you
a limited, royalty-free, worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable,
non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based on,
and redistribute the Software, in source code, binary, or any other form,
including any modifications or derivative works of the Software (collectively,
**“Licensed Software”**), in each case subject to this Ecosystem License
(**“License”**).

This License applies to all copies, modifications, derivative works, and any
other form or usage of the Licensed Software. You will include and display
this License, without modification, with all uses of the Licensed Software,
regardless of form.

You will use the Licensed Software solely (i) in connection with the Avalanche
Public Blockchain platform, having a NetworkID of 1 (Mainnet) or 5 (Fuji), and
associated blockchains, comprised exclusively of the Avalanche X-Chain,
C-Chain, P-Chain and any subnets linked to the P-Chain (“Avalanche Authorized
Platform”) or (ii) for non-production, testing or research purposes within the
Avalanche ecosystem, in each case, without any commercial application
(“Non-Commercial Use”); provided that this License does not permit use of the
Licensed Software in connection with (a) any forks of the Avalanche Authorized
Platform or (b) in any manner not operationally connected to the Avalanche
Authorized Platform other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the limited
exception for Non-Commercial Use. Ava Labs may publicly announce changes or
additions to the Avalanche Authorized Platform, which may expand or modify
usage of the Licensed Software. Upon such announcement, the Avalanche
Authorized Platform will be deemed to be the then-current iteration of such

modify it.

Except as required or explicitly permitted by this License, you will not use
any Ava Labs names, logos, or trademarks without Ava Labs’ prior written
consent.

You may use this License for software other than the “Licensed Software”
specified above, as long as the only change to this License is the definition
of the term “Licensed Software.”

The Licensed Software may reference third party components. You acknowledge
and agree that these third party components may be governed by a separate
license or terms and that you will comply with them.

**TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED
