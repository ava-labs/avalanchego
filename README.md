Official node implementation of the [Avalanche](https://avax.network) network -
a blockchains platform with high throughput, and blazing fast transactions.

## Installation

Avalanche is an incredibly lightweight protocol, so the minimum computer requirements are quite modest.

- Hardware: 2 GHz or faster CPU, 4 GB RAM, 20 GB hard disk.
- OS: Ubuntu >= 18.04 or Mac OS X >= Catalina.
- Software: [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version >= 1.15.5 and set up [`$GOPATH`](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH).
- Network: IPv4 or IPv6 network connection, with an open public port.

### Native Install

Clone the AvalancheGo repository:

```sh
go get -v -d github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/...
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego
```

#### Building the Avalanche Executable

Build Avalanche using the build script:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh
```

The Avalanche binary, named `avalanchego`, is in the `build` directory.

### Docker Install

Make sure docker is installed on the machine - so commands like `docker run` etc. are available.

Building the docker image of latest avalanchego branch can be done by running:

```sh
./scripts/build_image.sh
```

To check the built image, run:

```sh
docker image ls
```

The image should be tagged as `avaplatform/avalanchego:xxxxxxxx`, where `xxxxxxxx` is the shortened commit of the Avalanche source it was built from. To run the avalanche node, run:

```sh
docker run -ti -p 9650:9650 -p 9651:9651 avaplatform/avalanchego:xxxxxxxx /avalanchego/build/avalanchego
```

## Running Avalanche

### Connecting to Mainnet

To connect to the Avalanche Mainnet, run:

```sh
./build/avalanchego
```

You should see some pretty ASCII art and log messages.

You can use `Ctrl+C` to kill the node.

### Connecting to Fuji

To connect to the Fuji Testnet, run:

```sh
./build/avalanchego --network-id=fuji
```

### Creating a Local Testnet

To create a single node testnet, run:

```sh
./build/avalanchego --network-id=local --staking-enabled=false --snow-sample-size=1 --snow-quorum-size=1
```

This launches an Avalanche network with one node.


### Running protobuf codegen
To regenerate the protobuf go code, run scripts/protobuf_codegen.sh from the root of the repo
This should only be necessary when upgrading protobuf versions or modifying .proto definition files
To use this script, you must have protoc and protoc-gen-go and have protoc on your $PATH 
https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/
If you extract protoc to ~/software/protobuf/, the following should work:
```sh
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/software/protobuf/bin/:~/go/bin
$ go get google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
$ scripts/protobuf_codegen.sh
```
