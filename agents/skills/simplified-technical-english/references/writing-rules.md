# ASD-STE100 Writing Rules — Summary and Sources

This file summarizes the public, official description of ASD-STE100 (Simplified Technical English). It paraphrases rule *categories*; it does not reproduce the standard's text or its ~900-word dictionary verbatim. For the authoritative document, request the free download at the official site.

## What ASD-STE100 Is

ASD-STE100 is a controlled natural language, first released in 1986 (as AECMA Document PSC-85-16598) by what is now ASD (the AeroSpace and Defense Industries Association of Europe). It was built at the request of European airlines — most staffed by non-native English speakers — who needed maintenance documentation that could not be misread, because a misread instruction on an aircraft can kill people. The standard is maintained by the Simplified Technical English Maintenance Group (STEMG) and has been free to download since Issue 6 (2013). The current edition is Issue 9 (January 2025).

## Structure

- **53 writing rules across 9 sections** covering word choice, grammar, sentence structure, and style.
- **A dictionary** of roughly 900 approved words, each restricted to one meaning and one part of speech, plus roughly 1,200 words to avoid with suggested replacements.
- **A terminology allowance**: organizations may define their own dictionary of approved technical nouns and verbs beyond the base ~900 words, for domain-specific vocabulary the base dictionary can't cover.

## Rule Categories (Paraphrased)

**Word choice**
- Use approved words only in their approved meaning and part of speech.
- Each word maps to exactly one meaning — don't rely on context to disambiguate a word that has several dictionary senses.
- Prefer the plainer, shorter, more common word over a formal or rare synonym.

**Verb forms**
- Permitted forms: infinitive, imperative, simple present, simple past, simple future, and past participle used only as an adjective.
- No present perfect, past perfect, or other compound/auxiliary constructions ("we have received" is not allowed; "we received" is).
- "-ing" forms are permitted only as a technical noun or as part of a technical noun, not as a verb form.

**Voice**
- Active voice is required for procedures and instructions.
- Passive voice is allowed only in descriptive text, and only when the actor performing the action is genuinely unknown or irrelevant to the reader.

**Sentence structure**
- One instruction per sentence.
- Maximum ~20 words per sentence for procedures/instructions; maximum ~25 words for descriptive text.
- Do not omit sentence parts (verb, subject, article) just to shorten the sentence — the standard explicitly warns that this creates ambiguity rather than clarity.
- Noun clusters (strings of nouns stacked as a modifier) are capped at 3 words.

**Paragraph and document structure**
- One topic per paragraph.
- Maximum ~6 sentences per paragraph.
- Use vertical (numbered or bulleted) lists for sequences, conditions, or complex enumerations instead of burying them in prose.

**Safety instructions**
- Safety-critical instructions must open with a clear command or condition, not be buried mid-sentence.

## Why This Skill Repurposes STE for Agent Output

STE was designed to eliminate ambiguity for a reader who cannot ask a follow-up question — a technician on a tarmac, working from a manual, with no author to call. An AI agent parsing another agent's output, a tool description, or a system message is in the same position: no back-channel to resolve "does this passive-voice sentence mean the caller does X, or the callee does X?" The same rule set that protects an airline mechanic from a misread torque spec protects a downstream agent from a misread instruction.
